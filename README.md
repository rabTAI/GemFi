GemFI is a cutting-edge SVG NFT-based, user-driven GameFi project that puts all the power in the hands of the players. It is an engaging and dynamic GameFI with the unique thrill of potentially winning the big “Gem Pot“.

How to play?
> Players begin by minting three (or 3x) level 1 Gems, each with a starting balance of 1.

> To increase their level, players can upgrade Gems by sacrificing three of the same level Gems to mint a new, more powerful Gem.

> A successful 3:1 Gem Upgrade results in newly minted Gem with a total sum of the balances from sacrificed Gems.
    > This means that the player is not losing any money, while they are effectively increasing their chances of winning the coveted Gem Pot.
    > Upgrading Gems is a way to invest in the game and potentially reap a reward

> If the upgrade fails, a new Gem is returned with the same level and the balance from one of the three Gems.
    > The balance from the second Gem is refunded to the player in FTM, while the balance from the third Gem is accumulated in the Gem Pot.
    > Failed upgrades are calculated randomly based on the level of the three Gems, which adds an exciting element of risk to the game while providing an opportunity to recoup some of the investment.

> The Gem Pot winner is pulled randomly from all the eligible highest ranked Gems.

The pot is collected based on the number of failed upgrades from all players. This means that the more unsuccessful upgrades there are, the larger the Gem Pot becomes which will be scooped by one of the lucky players. The function 'pick winner' can be called by any eligible player every 24 hours, although this frequency can be changed at a later time.

It is possible for a player to have multiple highest ranked Gems and increase their chances of winning the Gem Pot prize. The more Gems a player has with the highest rank, the more chances they have to win the prize. This adds an extra layer of strategy and excitement to the game, as players can choose to upgrade different Gems and invest in their potential to win the Gem Pot.
